# Melissa HTTP Server Project
*Nobody should question my love about HTTP*

Melissa is a HTTP server project that aims to be a simple, fast, lightweight HTTP server.
## Some ideas and plans
- My main moral was making it can run at kernel-level
	- but it can also be compiled as standalone user-level
- It'll serve static content itself, for dynamic content it'll redirect request to a [higher level server](https://github.com/PEPSIMANTR/AlyssaHTTPServer)
- More features than absolute minimum may be added as compile-time options

That's all that currently comes into my mind.
